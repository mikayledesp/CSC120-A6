- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

My initial impression of Inheritence programming wise is that it makes having classes with slightly different alterations way easier as I can use the code established in the parent class and just add on to what I've done!

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
In my opinion, watching additional youtube videos that elaborated on what inheritance actually did helped a lot as I had a really hard time grasping on why they were needed to be put into place. What didn't work for me personally was just coding without having a clear idea of the exact outcome of each method. My adivce would be to leave comments or write in a seperate google doc ideas and pseudo code of what each method could do.
